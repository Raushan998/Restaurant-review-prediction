# Restaurant-review-prediction

when customer usually visit restaurant, they are having good and bad experience with restaurant,they usually review their experience on restaurant app or website or at google Map.so,we analysed on the data set for knowing positive and negative review.

## Library Used

* Natural Language Processing
* Numpy
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Schikit Learn

## Preprocessing

* cleaning the dataset.
* collecting the important features of all reviews given by customers as positive and negative.
* Splitting the dataset into training set and test set.
* Training Set-80%
* Test Set-20%

## Result
Accuracy for different Algorithm:

* Support Vector Machine Algorithm-48.5%
* KNeighborsClassifier Algorithm-61%
* Logistic Regression Algorithm-71%
* Decision Tree Classifier Algorithm-71%
* Naive Bayes Algorithm-73%
